**Unit 2: Object-Oriented Programming** <span id="2"></span> 
*Java is an Object-Oriented programming language. Since Object-Oriented
programming (OO) is currently one of the most popular programming
paradigms, you will need to learn its fundamental concepts in order to
build a career in Computer Science. This unit will begin with a
discussion of what makes OO programming so unique, and why its
advantages have made it the industry-standard paradigm for newly
designed programs. We will then discuss the fundamental concepts of OO
and relate them back to Java. By the end of this unit, you will have a
strong understanding of what Object-Oriented programming is, how it
relates to Java, and why it is employed.*

**2.2.2 Encapsulation** <span id="2.2.2"></span> 
*Encapsulation is to put both data, and operations that can be performed
on this data, in a single class. The advantages of encapsulation include
information hiding, which means the user does not need to know the
implementation details of the internal design, but is still be able to
access and modify the data through public operations provided. The
second part of David J. Eck’s* Introduction to Programming Using Java*:
“Section 1.5 Objects and Object-Oriented Programming” gives a specific
example to illustrate the concept of encapsulation.*

**2.2.3 Inheritance** <span id="2.2.3"></span> 
*Inheritance is to reuse the existing classes when creating a new class.
The derived class will inherit public operations defined in the base
class. It usually involves a hierarchy of related entities such as the
example given in the last part of David J. Eck’s* Introduction to
Programming Using Java*: “Section 1.5 Objects and Object-Oriented
Programming” gives a specific example to illustrate the concept of
encapsulation. Read the following article as well for another example.*
