**Unit 3: Java Fundamentals** <span id="3"></span> 
*Now that you have a basic understanding of OO programming, we will move
on to the fundamental concepts of the programming language we will be
studying this semester: Java. The Java-related concepts you will learn
in this unit are in many cases directly transferable to a number of
other languages. We will begin by learning about “Hello World,” a basic
software application that simply prints “Hello World” to the screen as a
means of demonstrating the most essential elements of a programming
language, and will then move on to discuss the more fundamental concepts
of variables, literals, data types, and operators. In addition, we will
also learn about two different styles of adding comments to the code. By
the end of this unit, you should have a fundamental understanding of
Java basics and be prepared to utilize those concepts later in the
course.*

Types,” slide 9 “Floating Point Literals,” slide 10 “Scientific
Notation,” slide 11 “Precision of Floating Point Numbers,” slide 12
“Precision of Double.”*

**3.2.3.3 Booleans** <span id="3.2.3.3"></span> 
*Booleans is a data type that only stores a value “true” or “false.”
Booleans type is fundamental to implement Boolean logic expression. Pay
attention to the text below the headings “Primitive Data Type Boolean.”*

**3.2.3.4 Chars** <span id="3.2.3.4"></span> 
*Chars is a data type that stores a single character. The char type

explicitly. Read the text below the heading “Mixed Floating Point and
Integer Expressions,” and read the next three slides. Though the text in
these slides do not mention it explicitly, the conversion of one type of
data (integers in the example) to another type of data (floating point
in the example) is automatically done by the compiler and is referred to
as* type-casting*or* simply casting*.*
