Course Syllabus for "CS101: Introduction to Computer Science I"
---------------------------------------------------------------

This course will introduce you to the field of computer science and the
fundamentals of computer programming. Introduction to Computer Science I
is specifically designed for students with no prior programming
experience, and taking this course does not require a background in
Computer Science. This course will touch upon a variety of fundamental
topics within the field of Computer Science and will use Java, a
high-level, portable, and well-constructed computer programming language
developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle), to demonstrate those
principles. We will begin with an overview of the course topics as well
as a brief history of software development. We will cover basic
object-oriented programming terminology and concepts such as objects,
classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, as well as the fundamentals of
Java, its primitive data types, relational operators, control
statements, exception handling, and file input /output. By the end of
the course, you should have a strong understanding of the fundamentals
of Computer Science and the Java programming language. This course will
lays groundwork for a strong educational in Computer Science and a
successful career devoted to implementing the principles you will learn
as you progress through the CS major. **This course provides students
the opportunity to earn actual college credit. It has been reviewed and
recommended for 3 credit hours by [The National College Credit
Recommendation Service](http://www.nationalccrs.org/) (NCCRS). While
credit is not guaranteed at all schools, we have
[partnered](http://www.saylor.org/partner-schools/) with a number of
schools who have expressed their willingness to accept transfer of
credits earned through Saylor. You can read more about our NCCRS program
[here](http://www.saylor.org/student-credit-pathways/nccrs/).**

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

-   describe the history of computing;
-   describe fundamental hardware and software concepts;
-   explain how the JVM translates Java code into executable code;
-   explain Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as objects,
    classes, inheritance and polymorphism;

-   describe and use primitive data types in Java;
-   describe and use logical and relational operators and compare
    Boolean expressions;
-   explain and use various control structures such as methods, decision
    statements, and loops;
-   use exception handling mechanism; and
-   use Java input/output class hierarchy to read and write data to and
    from external files. 

### Course Requirements

In order to take this course, you must:  
  
 √    have access to a computer;  
  
 √    have continuous broadband Internet access;  
  
 √    have the ability/permission to install plug-ins or software (e.g.
Adobe Reader or Flash);  
  
 √    have the ability to download and save files and documents to a
computer;   
  
 √    have the ability to open Microsoft files and documents (.doc,
.ppt, .xls, etc.);  
  
 √    have competency in the English language; and  
  
 √    have read the [Saylor Student
Handbook](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Saylor-StudentHandbook.pdf).

### Course Information

**Welcome to Introduction to Computer Science I.** Below you will find
some general information on the course and its requirements.  
  
 **Primary Resources: **This course is composed of a range of different
free online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   Central Connecticut State University: Bradley Kjell’s *[Introduction
    to Computer Science Using
    Java](http://chortle.ccsu.edu/CS151/cs151java.html) |* [mirror
    site](http://programmedlessons.org/java5/index.html)
-   Oracle’s *[The Java
    Tutorials](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html)*

**Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Pay special attention to Unit 1, as this introduction lays the
groundwork for understanding the more advanced, exploratory material
presented in latter units. You will also need to complete the Final
Exam.  
    
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all of the resources in each unit.  
    
 In order to *pass* this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment: **Completing this course should take you a total
of **94.5 hours**. Each unit includes a *time advisory* that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These
advisories should help you plan your time accordingly. It might be
useful to take a look at these time advisories and to determine how much
time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to
set goals for yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you 16.5 hours.
Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete
Subunit 1.1 (a total of 3 hours) on Monday; Subunit 1.2.1 (a total of 2
hours and 30 minutes) on Tuesday; Subunits 1.2.2 and 1.2.3 (a total of
4.25 hours) on Wednesday; etc.
