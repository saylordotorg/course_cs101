**Unit 1: Introduction** <span id="1"></span> 
*We will begin this course by identifying our motivation for learning
fundamental programming concepts and learning the history of programming
languages in general. We will then discuss the hardware (the physical
devices that make up the computer) and software (Operating Systems and
applications that run on the computer) of a computer. We will conclude
with a brief discussion of the Java programming language, which we will
use throughout the rest of this course. By the end of this unit, you
will have a strong understanding of the history of programming and be
well prepared to learn about programming concepts in greater detail.*

    Numbers”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ry1hpm1GXVI) (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Watch this lecture on Binary Numbers. They are used
    to represent numbers in computer memory. In fact, all types of
    information, not just numbers, but characters as well, are stored in
    memory using binary bits (i.e. digits) of 0 and 1. We still write
    numbers in our programs using decimal numbers, but the interpreter
    converts them to binary when it interprets them for execution as
    part of a machine language instruction (the interpreter interprets
    the Java or Python statement to equivalent, i.e. same semantics,
    machine language statements). If you are familiar with and
    understand the concepts of base 10 radix (decimal number system) and
    base 2 radix (binary number system), you may skip this lecture.   
        
     Watching the lecture and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.

    Construction/Introduction”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Compiler-Construction_Introduction.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: This article defines a *compiler* and an
    *interpreter*. A compiler translates from one programming language
    to another. The translated program is saved and can be executed at
    a *later time*, hence the terms, *compile time* and *execution
    time*. An interpreter, on the other hand, translates a program and
    executes it at the *same time*. To execute it again, the interpreter
    would have to translate it again and then re-execute it. This
    assigned reading will elaborate on this distinction.  
      
     Reading this material and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.
