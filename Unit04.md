**Unit 4: Relational and Logical Operators in Java** <span
id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, we will discuss relational and logical operators in Java,
which provide the foundation for topics like control structures (which
we will further discuss in Unit 5). In this unit, we will start by
taking a look at operator notation. We will then discuss relational
operators as they apply to both numeric operands and object operands
before concluding the unit with an introduction to logical operators. By
the end of this unit, you should be able to perform comparisons and
logic functions in Java and have a fundamental understanding of how they
are employed.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 7.25 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.1: 0.25 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.2: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.3: 6 hours

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
-   explain relational operators such as \>,\>=, \<, \<=, ==, and !=;  
      
-   write Boolean expressions using relational operators;  
      
-   use logical operators such as &&, ||, and !; and to write compound
    (combined) Boolean expressions; and  
      
-   evaluate truth-tables.

**4.1 Operator Notations** <span id="4.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: The Saylor Foundation’s “Operator Notation”**
    Link: The Saylor Foundation’s [“Operator
    Notation”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CS101-4.1.1-Operator-Notation-FINAL.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read this article for the introduction of three types
    of operator notations: infix notation put the operator between the
    two operands, prefix notation put the operator before the operands,
    and postfix notation put the operator after the operands.  
        
     Reading this article and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.

     Instructions: Select the “Relational and Conditional (Logical)
    Operators” link in the table of contents, and read this section to
    learn about binary relational operators: Greater Than “\>,” Less
    Than “\<,” Equal To “==,” Not Equal To “!=,” Greater Than or Equal
    To “\>=,” and Less Than or Equal To “\<=.”  
      
     Reading this section and taking notes should take approximately 1
    hour.

    (MP3)  
      
     Instructions: Read the chapter. It covers relational and logical
    operators. It also discusses the use of these operators to write
    Boolean expressions. In particular, read the first five pages of
    this resource to understand how two Boolean expressions are
    compared. The rest of the pages in this tutorial introduce logical
    operators AND “&&,” OR “||,” and NOT “!,” and how they are used. Try
    working on the examples that are discussed while explaining these
    operators. Pay attention to how these logical operators are used to
    construct combined logical expressions.  
      
     Reading this chapter and taking notes should take approximately 3
    hours.
